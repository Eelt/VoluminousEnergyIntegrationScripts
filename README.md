# What is this all about?
Other mods may add new materials or items that would logically make sence to be processed in Voluminous Energy machines, but because Voluminous Energy doesn't have the recipes baked in, those machines can't process those items.

The solution to this problem, in all mods, has always been to use some sort of 3rd party tool, such as KubeJS or CraftTweaker to modify crafting recipes or add new ones to ensure proper functionality, especially in a modpack environment. Especially since using Forge and vanilla tags can only go so far.

Scripts that end with .js are JavaScript scripts intended for use with KubeJS.
